export const FAQS_DATA = [
  {
    q: "What is Legal Metrology verification?",
    a: "Legal Metrology verification is the statutory process of testing and stamping commercial weighing and measuring instruments (such as grocery scales, petrol dispensers, weighbridges, and jewellery balances) to ensure they comply with prescribed maximum permissible error limits and regulatory standards under the Legal Metrology Act, 2009."
  },
  {
    q: "Who can apply for verification?",
    a: "Any instrument owner, commercial business, trader, manufacturer, dealer, repairer, or petrol pump operator who uses weighing and measuring instruments for commercial transactions or trade can register and submit verification requests."
  },
  {
    q: "How can I track my application?",
    a: "You can track your application anytime using the 'Track Application' feature on this portal by entering your Application Reference ID (e.g., APP-2026-9812). The system shows real-time officer assignment, inspection schedule, and certificate generation status."
  },
  {
    q: "How can I verify a certificate?",
    a: "Citizens, consumers, and enforcement authorities can verify any certificate in seconds by entering the Certificate Number (e.g., LM-CERT-2026-00001) in the QR Verification section or by scanning the QR code physically printed on the verified instrument."
  },
  {
    q: "What happens when a certificate expires?",
    a: "Using an unverified or expired instrument for trade is a punishable offence under Section 24 of the Legal Metrology Act. The e-Metrology platform automatically issues automated alerts 30 days and 15 days in advance, allowing owners to schedule re-verification seamlessly before expiry."
  },
  {
    q: "Can field officers use mobile devices for inspections?",
    a: "Yes. The e-Metrology platform features a dedicated Mobile Inspection Module for Legal Metrology Officers (LMOs) and GATC inspectors to record test observations, capture geo-tagged photographic evidence of physical seals, and submit verification reports directly from the field."
